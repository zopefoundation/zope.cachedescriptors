Changes
=======

4.2.0 (2016-09-05)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.5.

- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.

- The properties from the ``property`` module all preserve the
  documentation string of the underlying function, and all except
  ``cachedIn`` preserve everything that ``functools.update_wrapper``
  preserves.

- ``property.CachedProperty`` is usable as a decorator, with or
  without dependent attribute names.

- ``method.cachedIn`` preserves the documentation string of the
  underlying function, and everything else that ``functools.wraps`` preserves.

3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
------------------

- Remove dependency on ZODB by allowing to specify storage factory for

  to the ``zope.cachedescriptors.method.cachedIn`` decorator.

- Remove zpkg-related file.

- Clean up package description and documentation a bit.

- Change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
